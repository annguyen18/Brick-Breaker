## Bricks Breaker

This is a project called "Animals Breaker" I made for for my Advanced Programming class. It is a delightful variation of the well-known game "Brick Breaker," implemented using Pygame. In this version, the traditional bricks are replaced with adorable cartoon animals, adding a charming and playful twist to the gameplay.
